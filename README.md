# b1_gym: Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots with Isaac Gym

`b1_gym` is a reinforcement learning framework adapted from [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym), designed for bipedal locomotion and extended with custom environments, curriculum strategies, and logging tools. It integrates NVIDIA Isaac Gym and RSL-RL.

## Environment Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04
- **Python Version**: 3.8
- **CUDA Version**: 11.8
- **PyTorch Version**: 2.4.1 + cu118
- **Other Dependencies**: See `environment.yml` 


## Features

-  Isaac Gym + RSL-RL integration  
-  Biped locomotion in rough terrain  
-  Modular curriculum and reward configuration  
-  Support for language-conditioned commands  
-  WandB integration for experiment tracking

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HcBlackYang/b1_gym.git
cd b1_gym
```

### 2. Create Conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate b1_gym_env
```

### 3. Install local packages (editable mode)

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -e ./third_party/rsl_rl
```

### 4. Install pytorch (with CUDA 11.8 support)

To install PyTorch 2.4.1 and compatible versions of torchvision and torchaudio with CUDA 11.8, run:

```bash
pip install torch==2.4.1+cu118 torchvision==0.19.1+cu118 torchaudio==2.4.1+cu118 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```


### 5 Install Isaac Gym

Isaac Gym is **not included in this repository**. You must manually download and install it from NVIDIA:

#### 1. Download Isaac Gym Preview 4

- Go to: [https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym)
- You’ll need to create an NVIDIA Developer account to access the download.

> Isaac Gym is only supported on Linux + NVIDIA GPU + CUDA 11.x

#### 2. Install Isaac Gym Python bindings

```bash
cd isaacgym/python
pip install -e .
```

Make sure this directory is added to your `PYTHONPATH` or installed in editable mode.

#### 3. Test the installation (optional)

```bash
cd isaacgym/examples
python 1080_balls_of_solitude.py
```

This test should open a viewer with bouncing balls. If it crashes, check your GPU and driver setup.

#### 4. Troubleshooting

- Refer to: `isaacgym/docs/index.html`
- Or check the NVIDIA developer forums for platform-specific issues




##  Training Example

```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task=b1
```

You can configure the task in `legged_gym/cfg/train/rough_b1.yaml`.



##  Evaluation

```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task=b1
```
